## Sara O'Connor

I'm an aspiring junior web developer who has spent 13 years in children's book publishing, the last five leading on digital. After a career editing fiction, I love trying to piece together the stories inside code. As a junior developer, I'd like to work hard on great projects in a learning-friendly environment where I can be creative and challenged.
