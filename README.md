## Sara O'Connor

After completing a four month intensive coding bootcamp, I'm an aspiring junior web developer who has spent 13 years in children's book publishing, the last five leading on digital. After a career editing fiction, I love trying to piece together the stories inside code. As a junior developer, I will work hard in a learning-friendly environment where I can be creative and challenged. Currently focusing on developing in Swift.

## Other skills
I work effectively with senior management to find solutions within budget, and communicate with respect and compassion with creatives (writers, designers, illustrators). The editor's job is to coordinate between the business and the ideas - and I've done it successfully over 200 times.

People compare editing someone's book to writing on their skin, so I'm well-versed in diplomacy, negotiation, prioritising change and searching for what people are really trying to say. I love to combine seemingly unrelated ideas into something new, and two such creations have generated revenue of over £1 million.

I've also been responsible for input and output of large data systems, producing endless standardised and customised reports.
